abstract: |
   Today state of science and tool kits python has become the predominantly
   programming language. However, previously existing parallel programming
   paradigms such as message passing in interface (MPI) have proven to be a
   useful asset when it comes to enhancing complex data flows while executing
   them on multiple computers including supercomputers. However many students
   do not have the time to learn C programming to utilize such advanced
   cyberinfrastructure. Hence, it is advantageous to access MPI from Python.
   We will be showcasing to you how you can easily deploy and use MPI via a tool called mpi4pi.
   We will also show you how to use mpi4pi in support of AI workflows.
   This is done by using TensorFlow with it, as well as the execution of
   parallel execution of TensorFlow.
