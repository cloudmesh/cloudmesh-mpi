# Overview

- [ ] TODO: Gregor, improves this section

After reflecting on the meeting I decided that in order to increase
your python knowledge and to also lead you towards research we will be
developing initially a tutorial that teaches students how to use MPI
(Message Passing Interface). We do this with something that is called
mpi4py. (later on we will use this to coordinate AI algorithms) We
will develop multiple sections to this tutorial and each of you will
each week work on a chapter so it can be redone by others. You can
also work together and share each others ideas and thoughts openly as
well as ask questions. We will do the following structured tasks (you
will need to know what plagiarism is and when and how you need to
cite):
