# Overview

Today state of science and tool kits python has become the
predominantly programming language. However, previously existing
parallel programming paradigms such as message passing in interface
(MPI) have proven to be a useful asset when it comes to enhancing
complex data flows while executing them on multiple computers
including supercomputers. However many students do not have the time
to learn C programming to utilize such advanced
cyberinfrastructure. Hence, it is advantageous to access MPI from
Python. We will be showcasing to you how you can easily deploy and use
MPI via a tool called `mpi4pi`.  We will also show you how to use
`mpi4pi` in support of AI workflows. This is done by using TensorFlow
with it, as well as the execution of parallel execution of TensorFlow.
