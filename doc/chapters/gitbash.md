# Install Git (and Git Bash) on Windows and Run as Administrator

Git is an open-source software which helps to manage repository version control, particularly with GitHub repos.

## Installation

To verify whether you have Git in the first place, you can press `Win + R` on your desktop, type `cmd`, and press `Enter`. Then type `git clone` and press `Enter`. If you do not have Git installed, it will say `'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command...`

As long as Git does not change the structure of their website and hyperlinks, you should be able to download Git from here and skip to Step #2: https://git-scm.com/downloads

1. Open a web browser and search `git`. Look for the result that is from `git-scm.com` and click Downloads.

2. Click `Download for Windows`. The download will commence. Open the file once it is finished downloading.

3. The UAC Prompt will appear. Click `Yes` because Git is a safe program. It will show you Git's license: a GNU General Public License. After understanding the terms, click `Next`.
   1. The GNU General Public License means that the program is open-source (free of charge).
  
4. Click `Next` to confirm that `C:\Program Files\Git` is the directory where you want Git to be installed.

5. Click `Next` unless you would like an icon for Git on the desktop (in which case you can check the box and then click `Next`).

6. Click `Next` to accept the text editor, click `Next` again to Let Git decide the default branch name, click `Next` again to run Git from the command line and 3rd party software, click `Next` again to use the OpenSSL library, click `Next` again to checkout Windows-style, click `Next` again to use MinTTY, click `Next` again to use the default git pull, click `Next` again to use the Git Credential Manager Core, click `Next` again to enable file system caching, and then click `Install` because the experimental features are not necessary.

7. Wait for the green progress bar to finish. Congratulationsâ€” you have installed Git and Git Bash. You can now run it as an administrator by pressing the Windows key, typing `git bash`, right clicking `Git Bash`, and clicking `Run as administrator`. Click `Yes` in the UAC prompt that appears.
