# Organizing Collaborative Research Teams

## Communication (Gregor)

To organize a research team, it is of utmost importance to
establish simple communication pathways. This includes ways to conduct
text chat
video conferencing,
code sharing,
editing, and 
task management.

In the following sections, we will list some useful tools that can be
used by the research team while keeping the learning curve to a
minimum. In general, it is good to ask the participants if they already
use particular tools in a category and if all in the team use them to
adopt them. However, this may limit the general availability in case
the team grows into the open-source community. Hence, it is important
to consider licensing issues and if possible adopt free tools for the
research team.

### Video Conferencing (Gregor)

Videoconferencing has undoubtfully become a major component of research
teams. It allows face meetings without the need for traveling. Thus
you can spend the time saved on travel. Also, it allows researchers to
continue if unexpected events take place that does not allow in-person
meetings such as the recent COVID epidemic. 

There are many confenencing tools available that can be used. You may
even use multiple dependent on the particular meeting or preferences
by the subgroup. In order to keep things simple it is however
recommended to jsut use one tool.

#### Google Meet (Shannon, Gregor)

Google Meet is an online platform that allows groups of people to host
video and audio conference calls. It has evolved from google hangout.

* **What are good features?** (Shannon)

  Some good features of Google
  meet include that it has a button for closed captioning or subtitles
  in the case that you're having trouble hearing the speaker.  It is
  also compatible across devices so it is very easy and accessible for
  all group members. The sound quality is very good.

* **What are not so good features?** (Gregor)

  1. Goggle meet does not provide an easy way to have other take control
     of a remote desktop. However, it is possible to use Google Remote
     Desktop for it.
     * <https://remotedesktop.google.com/?pli=1>
  2. Google meet does not have the ability to share each others
     desktops at tehe same time. This feature was available in hangout
     but is no longer available as far as we can tell.

* **Why do we use google meet and not zoom?** (Gregor)

  Google offers many services that are useful for collaboration. This
  includes Google drive, docs, presentations, mail, calendar, and
  groups.  features such as google drive. As they can be accessed
  through a single account, it is obvious that Google meet provides a
  valuable set of services to any research team.

#### Zoom (Fidel, Gregor)

Zoom is a cloud-based communications platform that provides support
for one-on-one, group meetings, and webinars and has recently become
one of the most popular video-conferencing tools.

* **What are good features?** (Fidel, Gregor)

  Some of Zoom’s most popular features include live chat, screen
  sharing, a whiteboard, and virtual reactions for meeting
  participants. Additionally, the ability to record meetings to the
  cloud or personal devices, create breakout rooms and seamlessly move
  between them, remotely control a participant’s screen and the
  functionality to share files in the meeting make Zoom into an
  attractive collaborative tool.  Zoom allows users to join any
  session through an established meeting URL. Participants do not need
  to be signed in or even have a Zoom account. Additionally, people
  joining from places with limited Internet access can call into the
  meeting’s audio channel using dedicated telephone numbers.

  
* **What are not so good features?** (Gregor, Fidel)

  Free account holders can host unlimited one-on-one meetings (meeting
  durations up to 24 hrs). In contrast to Google meet, there is a
  duration limit of 40 mins for meetings with three or more
  participants, making it difficult even for small teams to take
  advantage of the platform's features. Additionally, we observed that
  video quality can be unstable, and the overall platform performance
  can quickly deteriorate over limited bandwidth connections. In such
  cases, we recommend switching the camera from the participant that
  has issues.  Furthermore, if you do at the same time a lot of
  calculations on your machine it may affect the quality of the
  call. This applied to older machines and should allow you to give a
  beautiful argument to get a new computer. In some cases, you may
  have a second computer and can use one for sharing your session,
  while the other one is used for sound, or you use a cell phone for
  the later

* **How can someone take control of a remote desktop?** (Fidel)

  To take control of a remote desktop, the remote user must activate
  screen sharing. Once the screen sharing is activated, we need to
  click the `View Options` dropdown menu (usually at the top of the
  screen) and click on `Request remote control`. The remote user will
  then get a prompt to approve the remote control request.

  Institutional accounts may have the remote control functionality
  disabled by their account administrator. For further details, refer
  to the
  [Zoom support pages](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362673-Requesting-or-giving-remote-control).


### Realtime nad Offline Text Messaging (Gregor)

In many research projects participants may be in different timezones
or have schedules that do not provide ovelapping times for
video-conferencing. For this reason it is important to support a chat
like feature, that allows the researchers to catch up with activities
that took place they were not avaialable for. Tools such as e-mail
have filled this demand for quite some time. Recently addionlal tools
such as Slack have appearde that enhance the e-mail activity while
also allwing real time text messaging,



#### Slack (Gregor, Cooper)

 Slack is a communication software that is used for groups to
 send and receive text messages and access services that can be added
 to slack.

* **What are good features?** (Gregor)
 
Slack offers a GUI that is liked by many while focussing on a stream
of messages. It can be used on any device.  It is easy to send photos,
which may be useful in case the device you need to discuss is not on
the internet but you need to share the content for example of its
screen.

* **What are not so good features?** (Gregor)

Slack is stream-based and does not provide a good mechanism for
organizing messages. The thread feature is far inferior to that of
even a simple e-mail client. If one is involved in many slack
workspaces, it becomes difficult to manage them. Most importantly
Slack comes in its free version with only a limited number of free
messages. This means you will have to pay once you exceed the limit.
Thus even the integration of useful services such as GitHub
notifications is not recommended as you will too quickly exceed the
limits. A posting policy needs to be established.  Those that are not
using slack frequently may be out of touch quickly. Although there is
an unread threads feature, it may be filled with messages if you do
not use slack daily just to keep up.

To support separation of topics it is advisable to create a number of
channels such as "general" or a chanel for a particular topic. However
it is also important to limit the number of channels so it does not
become too confusing

## Creating Text (Gregor)

- [ ] TODO: Gregor,  Introduction

### Dictation (Gregor, Windows 10 try out, Agness)

Sometimes it is conveneinet to directly dictate the text for a manual
or tutorial into an editor. On MacOS and Windows you will find useful
tools for this.  A Voice to text recorder may also help you in case
you have a recoded video of yourself to generate
transcripts. Disadvantag for a lot of non Native english speakers is
that the accuraccy may be limited and that not using them leads to
unacceptable results. Some of them can be trained. Try it out and let
us know if they work for you and if you are satisfied with their
accuracy. Examples include:

* [Apple Dictation](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210539) (free
  for Apple devices) You can directly dictate into various
  applicatipns that help you improving your text such as Grammarly and
  MS Word if you have installed them

*c[Windows 10 Voice Recognition](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-voice-recognition-in-windows-10-83ff75bd-63eb-0b6c-18d4-6fae94050571)
  (free for Windows users). You can directly record into MS Word so you
  get a free grammar checcker

  > Agnes: I tried windows voice recognition
  and it did not work on my computer
* [Google Docs](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/4492226?hl=en) offers buidl in voice typing for dictating 
  Google voice has a very good recognition success rate it is fast but
  has at times difficultis recognizing names. In case
  it makes mistakes, you will have to clean it up after dictation. 
  
* - [ ] TODO: Agnes, can we dictate into MS word? ... leran how to write in third person 

### Grammar Checkers (Gregor, review Erin)

When developing content for tutorials and documentation it is
important to check their correctness with a grammar checcker. We have
made the best experience with Grammarly followed by MS word. The best
way to use them is to copy and paste small sections into them from
your document and then check them. After you are satisfied copy the
contents back to the original one, while overwriting the old text.

* Grammarly
    * Pro: works well, is available for free, the free version is good enough
    * Cons: not everything is done correct. In some text it shows false errors, but it's still very good 
* Word
    * Pros: those familiar with word will know it
    * Cons: sometimes Grammarly performs better, Copying text back and forth can introduce errors when it comes to using quotes and other symbols. Thus you must check all symbols after you copy it into a markdown document.

Recommendation: use Grammarly

### Editors

You will need likely multiple two editors as part of your research
activities. This is motivated by the fact that we do lots of
development on yourl local machine, but also do remote development via
terminal access to a remote computer that does not have a GUI. In case
you only want t learn one editor to do all of this, just use emacs. We
have listed bellow some editors and youmay want to chose

* emacs vs vi/vim for terminal editing
* pycharm vs MS code for fancyful python code development

There is a third option that we will use and that is jupyter which
allows us to interactively develp python code. Jupyter is important as
it is used by many data scientist due to its ad hoc interactive mode
while programming. However, also pycharm and vscode prode options to
view and run jupyter notebooks. However, not everything that works in
jupyter is working on these platforms.

Recommendation: Use emacs and pyCharm

Terminal Editors

* emacs 
    * Pro: terminal, established, very good markdown support, block format with ESC-q, keyboard shortcuts also used in bash and ther shells, has a python and markdown mode
    * Cons: some users have a hard time remembering keyboard shortcuts, the editor may get stuck in some unkown mode that you activated by accident. ALL this is easy to fix by remembering CRTL-X-s (save) and CTRL-G (get out of a strange mode)
* vi
    * use vim instead, vi is availabel on all Linux machines, but has rather archaic editing controls.
* vim
    * Pros: like vi, but with cursor control
    * Cons: often awkward to use 

IDEs:
* Pycharm
    * Pro: best Python editor
    * Cons: needs lots of resources, steep learning curve
* Code (MS)
    * Pro: ofetn used on Raspberry
    * Cons: Pycharm seems to have more features from the start

## Documentation Development with Markdown ()

### Markdown ()

- [ ] TODO: Gregor, Open, point to book 

* What is markdown?
* Why do we use it?
* What a re good editors for markdon?
* Pointer to Gregor book
* Collaborative editing with HackMD.io

## ToDo Lists

- [ ] TODO: Gregor, improve TODO section 

It is important to communicate quickly some tasks in the document that
we write as a team. In order to do this we wuse the keyword TODO ,
followed usually by an explanation if needed. As a TODO  can be
hopefully resolved quickly it shoudl be able yp complete them in 1-2
hours. Any TODO  that may take longer we also add to our GitHub project
in order for it to be recorded and if we identify or delays in its
execution we can assign additional team members to help on this tasks.

Once a team member has identified a TODO  item, the team member can
simple put his name behwind it, as well as the data and time so others
know you work on it. You can aslo communicate on slack about the task
you do if you run into issues or have questions.

All: if you see a TODO , and want to do it (e.g. have 1-2 hours time,
put your name to it so others know you will work on it. Do not assign
a TODO  to you if you do not have time and will do it in a month from
now, Research tasks need to be done immediately. HOwever we will also
assign some longer term tasks to you so you can work ahead and in
parallel, if your task is not done it will be assigned to some one
else to mitigate that the time delay does not block the project.)

All: add tasks in github so we can assign todos and monitor progress

Gregor: Describe In detail how this is done


## Git and GitHub

Git is a distributed version control system to support working on
project in teams while allowing different team members to contribute
and to currate the contribution through reviews.

GitHub is a service offered for free with the limitation that the
repositories shoudl not be larger than 1GB and the individual files
must be smaller then 200MB. Github is very popular for OpenSource
projects and through its free offering allows community building
around OpenSource Projects.

### Git from the commandline

Git can easily be installed on all platforms including 

* macOS: You will need to install Xcode which includes not   only git but user Linux programs such as Makefile 
* Ubuntu: You can install it via `apt install git`
* Windows: You can install it via *Git Bash* which is   
  distributed from <https://git-scm.com/downloads>. When
  installing read carefully the available options. We 
  recommend you install a desktop shortcut.

## Git form IDEs

Pycharm is one of the best editors for Python. It does provide build
in support to interact with GitHub. This document here and I already
went to some of your contributions and made improvements or two then
OK

## GitHub from a GUI 

Some may fancy using a Graphical user interface to interact with
GitHub. However, in many cases, the terminal access is
simpler. However, if you like to browse the repositories and see the
commit tree, these GUI interfaces are useful. Several such interfaces
are available at:

* <https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis>

### GitHub Commands

* What are the most important commands?

  * pull
    - [ ] TODO: Shannon, git pull
    
  * git add FILENAME
    - [ ] TODO: Agnes, git add
    
  * commit -a
    - [ ] TODO: Agnes, git commit 
    
  * push
    - [ ] TODO: Erin, git push
    
  * checkout branchanme
    - [ ] TODO: Shannon, git branch

* What is a branch and how do we use it form the commandline?

  - [ ] TODO: Shannon, git branch
  
* What if you committed something you did not want to and pushed it?

That is realy bad and you need to contact Gregor
THis will take hours to fix, so be careful. So make sure you code does not contain passwords in plaintext.

Also do never ever use the git command `git add .` as that adds all files and you could have files that you do not want to commit. instead **always** use `git add FILENAME`, where FILENAME is the file you like to add
