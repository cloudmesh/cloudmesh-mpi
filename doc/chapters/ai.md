We will
also show you how to use `mpi4pi` in support of AI workflows such as
TensorFlow.

# Deep Learning on the PI

Assignment

1. Create a tutorial to install use tensorflow from an MPI program
2. Create a tutorial to install and use horovod. Explain relationship and differences to MPI


## Tensorflow

* tensorflow 2.3
<https://itnext.io/installing-tensorflow-2-3-0-for-raspberry-pi3-4-debian-buster-11447cb31fc4>
* Tensrflow: <https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/articles/tensorflow-ai-raspberry-pi>
This seems for older tensorflow we want 2.5.0
* Tensorflow 1.9 <https://blog.tensorflow.org/2018/08/tensorflow-19-officially-supports-raspberry-pi.html>
* Tensorflow 2.1.0 <https://qengineering.eu/install-tensorflow-2.1.0-on-raspberry-pi-4.html>
* Tensorflow <https://www.instructables.com/Google-Tensorflow-on-Rapsberry-Pi/>
* Horovod with mpi4py, see original horovod documentation
* Horovod goo, see if that works

## Tensorflow Lite

Build on Ubuntu and raspberry os are slightly different
