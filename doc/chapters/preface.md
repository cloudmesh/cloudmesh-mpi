* Who we are and how this activity came about.

* Notation. We can copy what I have done in other books, but keep it
  simple e.g. we do not have to worry about epub

  * code
  * use of `verbatim` inline and in block
  * use of LaTex formulas
  * use of markdown
    * spaces before and after headline, itemize lists, e.g. online editors do that not correctly
