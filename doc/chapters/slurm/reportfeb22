Begin with Python 3.9.8 on Windows 10 Pro
Begin from Section 4 in raspberry burn windows tutorial

I suggest adding `cd ..` immediately before `cd cloudmesh-inventory` in section 4.2.

In Section 5, instead of doing the first block of code, we do
```
cms burn image versions --refresh
cms burn image get latest-lite-legacy
```

when doing `cms burn raspberry` command, do NOT include `--new` parameter!

When attempting to ssh to the Pis, ensure that on the laptop, the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file does not have conflicting entries for past red configurations.

Another note: when scattering the keys on windows, it might help to cd to the .ssh folder if you receive a "ERROR The file does not exist" error otherwise.
