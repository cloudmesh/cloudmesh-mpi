## Document Notation

To keep things uniform we use the following document notations.

1.  Empty lines are to be placed before and after a context change such
    as a headline, paragraph, list, image inclusion.

2.  All code is written in code blocks using the `>` and three back
    quotes. A rendered example looks as follows:

    >     this is an example

3.  Using code inclusion in a line is not allowed. Single quote
    inclusion must be used for filenames, and other names as they are
    refereed to in code blocks.

4.  Do showcase command inclusion we use a block but preceed every
    command with a `$` or other prefix indicating the computer on which
    the command is executed.

    >     $ ls 

5.  Formulas are written as LaTeX formulas

6.  We use regular markdown

7.  Inclusions are handled by pandoc-include

8.  bibliography is managed via footnotes

# Overview

Today state of science and tool kits python has become the predominantly
programming language. However, previously existing parallel programming
paradigms such as message passing in interface (MPI) have proven to be a
useful asset when it comes to enhancing complex data flows while
executing them on multiple computers including supercomputers. However
many students do not have the time to learn C programming to utilize
such advanced cyberinfrastructure. Hence, it is advantageous to access
MPI from Python. We will be showcasing to you how you can easily deploy
and use MPI via a tool called `mpi4pi`. We will also show you how to use
`mpi4pi` in support of AI workflows. This is done by using TensorFlow
with it, as well as the execution of parallel execution of TensorFlow.

# Introduction to MPI

-   What is MPI and why do you want to use it

-   What are some example MPI functionalities and usage patterns (send
    receive, embarrassing parallel)

## MPI

-   [ ] TODO: Open, what is mpi
    <https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-mpi/issues/19>

Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a message-passing standard that
allows for efficient communication of data between the address spaces of
multiple processes. Work on the creation of the standard began in 1992
as a collective effort undertaken by several organizations,
institutions, vendors and users. Since the presentation of the first
draft in November of 1993, the standard has undergone several revisions
and updates leading to its current version: MPI 4.0 (June 2021).

MPI is a specification, meaning that there can be multiple
implementations of the standard. Examples of popular implementations are
MPICH and Open MPI, although many other free or commercial
implementations exist.

Additionally, MPI is a language-independent interface. Although support
for C and Fortran is included as part of the standard, multiple
libraries providing bindings fot other languages are available,
including those for Java, Julia, R, Ruby and Python.

Thanks to its standardized nature, the portability and scalability it
provides, and to the many available implementations, MPI is a popular
tool in the creation of high performance and parallel computing
programs.

## Prerequisite

For the examples listed in this document, it is important to know the
number of cores in your computer. This can be found out through the
command line or a python program.

In Python, you can do it with

> ``` python
> import multiprocessing
> multiprocessing.cpu_count()
> ```

or as a command line

> ``` bash
> $ python -c "import multiprocessing;  print(multiprocessing.cpu_count())"
> ```

Alternatively, you can use the following

Linux:

> ``` bash
> $ nproc
> ```

macOS:

> ``` bash
> $ sysctl hw.physicalcpu hw.logicalcpu
> ```

Windows:

> ``` bash
> $ wmic CPU Get DeviceID,NumberOfCores,NumberOfLogicalProcessors
> ```

## Installation

### Installation of mpi4py on Windows

1.  First you need to download msmpi from

    -   <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/message-passing-interface/microsoft-mpi#ms-mpi-downloads>

    Go to the download link underneath the heading `MS-MPI Downloads`
    and download and install it. Select the two packages and click Next.
    When downloaded, click on them and complete the setups.

    >     msmpisetup.exe
    >     msmpisdk.msi

2.  Open the system control panel and click on
    `Advanced system settings` (which can be searched for with the
    search box in the top-right, and then click
    `View advanced system settings`) and then click
    `Environment Variables...`

3.  Under the user variables box click on `Path`

4.  Click New in order to add
    `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\MPI` and
    `C:\Program Files\Microsoft MPI\Bin` to the Path. The
    `Browse Directory...` button makes this easier and the
    `Variable name` can correspond to each directory, e.g.Â "MPI" and
    "MPI Bin" respectively

5.  Close any open bash windows and then open a new one

6.  Type the command

    > ``` bash
    > $ which mpiexec
    > ```

    to verify if it works.

7.  After you verified it is available, install mpi4py with

    > ``` bash
    > $ pip install mpi4py
    > ```

    ideally while bash is in venv

8.  The installation can be tested with
    `mpiexec -n 4 python -m    mpi4py.bench helloworld` (depending on
    the number of cores/nodes available to you, it may be necessary to
    reduce the number of copies that follow the -n option):

    >     (ENV3) pi@red:~ $ mpiexec -n 4 python -m mpi4py.bench helloworld
    >     Hello, World! I am process 0 of 4 on red.
    >     Hello, World! I am process 1 of 4 on red.
    >     Hello, World! I am process 2 of 4 on red.
    >     Hello, World! I am process 3 of 4 on red.

### Installing mpi4pi on Ubuntu

The instalation of mpi4py on ubuntu is relatively easy. Please follow
these steps. We recommend that you create a python `venv` so you do not
by accident interfere with your system python. As usual you can activate
it in your
`.bashrc file while adding the source line there. Lastly, make sure you check it out and adjust the`-n\`
parameters to the number of cores of your machine.

> `` bash $ sudo apt install python3.9 python3.9-dev $ python3 -m venev ~/ENV3 $ source `/ENV3/bin/activate` (ENV3) $ sudo apt-get install -y mpich-doc mpich  (ENV3) $ pip install mpi4py -U (ENV3) $ mpiexec -n 4 python -m mpi4py.bench helloworld > ``

### Installing mpi4py in a Raspberry Pi

1.  Activate our virtual environment:

    > ``` bash
    > $ python -m venv ~/ENV3
    > $ source ~/ENV3/bin/activate
    > ```

2.  Install Open MPI in your pi by entering the following command:

    >     $ sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin

    After installation is complete you can check if it was successful by
    using

    >     $ mpicc --showme:version

3.  Enter

    >     $ pip install mpi4py

    to download and install mpi4py.

4.  The installation can be tested with
    `mpiexec -n 4 python -m    mpi4py.bench helloworld` (depending on
    the number of cores/nodes available to you, it may be necessary to
    reduce the number of copies that follow the -n option) In a PI4, the
    previous test returned:

    >     (ENV3) pi@red:~ $ mpiexec -n 4 python -m mpi4py.bench helloworld
    >     Hello, World! I am process 0 of 4 on red.
    >     Hello, World! I am process 1 of 4 on red.
    >     Hello, World! I am process 2 of 4 on red.
    >     Hello, World! I am process 3 of 4 on red.

### Installing mpi4py in MacOS

A similar process can be followed to install mpi4py in macOS. In this
case, we can use Homebrew to get Open MPI floowed by installing mpi4py
in your venv

    $ xcode-select --install
    $ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    $ brew install wget
    $ brew install open-mpi
    $ python3 -m venv ~/ENV3
    $ source ~/ENV3/bin/activate
    $ pip install mpi4py

### Installing Homebrew on MacOS

1.  Download Xcode from appstore

2.  Open Terminal from Applications

3.  Run:

    > ``` bash
    > $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)"
    > ```

4.  Enter password

5.  Hit return

6.  Follow instructions on screen

## Hello World

To test if it works a build-in test program is available.

To run it on on a single host with n cores (lest assume you have 2
cores), you can use:

>     mpiexec -n 4 python -m mpi4py.bench helloworld
>     Hello, World! I am process 0 of 5 on localhost.
>     Hello, World! I am process 1 of 5 on localhost.
>     Hello, World! I am process 2 of 5 on localhost.
>     Hello, World! I am process 3 of 5 on localhost.

Note that the messages can be in a different order.

To run it on multiple hosts with each having n cores please create a
`hostfile` as follows:

-   [ ] TODO: Open, how to run it on multiple hosts on the PI

## Ring computation using mpi4py

As an example of the use of mpi4py, we present an instance of
communication between a group of processes organized in a ring.

\[Processes organized in a ring perform a sum operation\]
(https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-mpi/raw/main/doc/images/ring.png)

In the example, the user provides an integer that is transmitted from
process with rank 0, to process with rank 1 and so on until the data
returns to process 0. Each process increments the integer by 1 before
transmitting it to the next one, so the final value received by process
0 after the ring is complete is the sum of the original integer plus the
number of processes in the communicator group.

> ``` python
> #!/usr/bin/env python
>
> #
> # mpieec -n 4 python ring.py --count 1000
> #
> #  .....

>     if rank == 0:
>         print(f'Communicator group with {size} processes')
>         # User provides data to transmit through the ring

>             # Data is received from last process in the ring
>             data = comm.recv(data, source=size - 1)
>             if debug:
>                 print(f'Final data received in process 0 after ring is completed: {data}')
>
>         elif rank == size - 1:
>           
>             # Data is received from previous process in the ring
>             data = comm.recv(source=rank - 1)
>             # Data is modified
>             data += 1
>             # Data is sent to process 0, closing the ring
>             comm.send(data, dest=0)
>             #print(f'Process {rank} transmitted value {data} to process 0')
>
>         elif 0 < rank < size -1:
>             # Data is received from previous process in the ring
>             data = comm.recv(source=rank - 1)
>             # Data is modified
>             data += 1
>             # Data is sent to next process in the ring
>             comm.send(data, dest=rank + 1)
>             # print(f'Process {rank} transmitted value {data} to process {rank + 1}')
>
>     if rank == 0:
>         print(f'Final data received in process 0 after ring is completed: {data}')
>         # verify
>         assert data == count * size
>
>     if rank == 0:
>         Stopwatch.stop(f"ring {size} {count}")
>         Stopwatch.benchmark()
>
>
>       
> if __name__ == '__main__':
>     ring()
> ```

Executing the code in the example by entering
`mpiexec -n 2 python ring.py` in the terminal will produce the following
result:

> ``` bash
> Communicator group with 4 processes
> Enter an integer to transmit: 6
> Process 0 transmitted value 7 to process 1
> Process 1 transmitted value 8 to process 2
> Process 2 transmitted value 9 to process 3
> Process 3 transmitted value 10 to process 0
> Final data received in process 0 after ring is completed: 10
> ```
>
> As we can see, the integer provided to process 0 (6 in this case) was
> successively incremented by each process in the communicator group to
> return a final value of 10 at the end of the ring.

## MPI Functionality examples

There are some differences between mpi4py and the standard MPI
implementations for C/Fortran worth noting.

In mpi4py, the standard MPI_INIT() and MPI_FINALIZE() commonly used to
initialize and terminate the MPI environment are automatically handled
after importing the mpi4py module. Although not generally advised,
mpi4py still provides MPI.Init() and MPI.Finalize() for users interested
in manually controlling these operations. Additionally, the automatic
initialization and termination can be deativated. For more information
on this topic, please check the following links:

-   [MPI.Init() and
    MPI.Finalize()](https://githubmemory.com/repo/mpi4py/mpi4py/issues/54)
-   [Deactivating automatic initialization and termination on
    mpi4py](https://bitbucket.org/mpi4py/mpi4py/issues/85/manual-finalizing-and-initializing-mpi)

Another characteristic feature of mpi4py is the availablitly of
uppercase and lowercase communication methods. Lowercase methods like
`comm.send()` use Python's `pickle` module to transmit objects in a
serialized manner. In contrast, the uppercase versions of methods like
`comm.Send()` enable transmission of data contained in a contiguous
memory buffer, as featured in the MPI standard. For additional
information on the topic, check
(https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html?highlight=pickle#communicating-python-objects-and-array-data).

## MPI Point-to-Point Communication Examples

### Sending/Receiving

The `send()` and `recv()` methods provide for functionality to transmit
data between two specific processes in the communicator group.

\[Sending and receiving data between two processes\]
(https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-mpi/raw/main/doc/images/send_receive.png)

Here is the definition for the `send()` method:

>     comm.send(buf, dest, tag)

`buf` represents the data to be transmitted, `dest` and `tag` are
integer values that specify the rank of the destination process, and a
tag to identify the message being passed, respectively. `tag` is
particularly useful for cases when a process sends multiple kinds of
messages to another process.

In the other end is the `recv()` method, with the following definition:

>     comm.recv(buf, source, tag, status)

In this case, `buf` can specify the location for the received data to be
stored. In more recent versions of MPI, 'buf' has been deprecated. In
those cases, we can simply assign `comm.recv(source, tag, status)` as
the value of our buffer variable in the receiving process. Additionally,
`source` and `tag` can specify the desired source and tag of the data to
be received. They can also be set to `MPI.ANY_SOURCE` and `MPI.ANY_TAG`,
or be left unspecified.

In the following example, an integer is transmitted from process 0 to
process 1.

> ``` python
> #!/usr/bin/env python
> from mpi4py import MPI
>
> # Communicator
> comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
>
> # Get the rank of the current process in the communicator group
> rank = comm.Get_rank()
>
> # Variable to receive the data
> data = None
>
> # Process with rank 0 sends data to process with rank 1
> if rank == 0:
>     comm.send(42, dest=1)
>
> # Process with rank 1 receives and stores data
> if rank == 1:
>     data = comm.recv(source=0)
>
> # Each process in the communicator group prints its data
> print(f'After send/receive, the value in process {rank} is {data}')
> ```

Executing `mpiexec -n 4 python send_receive.py` yields:

> ``` bash
> After send/receive, the value in process 2 is None
> After send/receive, the value in process 3 is None 
> After send/receive, the value in process 0 is None
> After send/receive, the value in process 1 is 42
> ```

As we can appreciate, transmission only occurred between processes 0 and
1, and no other process was affected.

The following example illustrates the use of the uppercase versions of
the methods `comm.Send()` and `comm.Recv()` to perform a buffered
transmission of data between processes 0 and 1 in the communicator
group.

> ``` python
> #!/usr/bin/env python
> import numpy as np
> from mpi4py import MPI
>
> # Communicator
> comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
>
> # Get the rank of the current process in the communicator group
> rank = comm.Get_rank()
>
> # Create empty buffer to receive data
> buf = np.zeros(5, dtype=int)
>
> # Process with rank 0 sends data to process with rank 1
> if rank == 0:
>     data = np.arange(1, 6)
>     comm.Send([data, MPI.INT], dest=1)
>
> # Process with rank 1 receives and stores data
> if rank == 1:
>     comm.Recv([buf, MPI.INT], source=0)
>
> # Each process in the communicator group prints the content of its buffer
> print(f'After Send/Receive, the value in process {rank} is {buf}')
> ```

Executing `mpiexec -n 4 python send_receive_buffer.py` yields:

> ``` bash
> After Send/Receive, the value in process 3 is [0 0 0 0 0]
> After Send/Receive, the value in process 2 is [0 0 0 0 0]
> After Send/Receive, the value in process 0 is [0 0 0 0 0]
> After Send/Receive, the value in process 1 is [1 2 3 4 5]
> ```

Lastly, an example of the non-blocking send and receive methods
`comm.isend()` and `comm.irecv()`. Non-blocking versions of these
methods allow for the processes involved in transmission/reception of
data to perform other operations in overlap with the communication. In
contrast, the blocking versions of these methods previously exemplified
do not allow data buffers involved in transmission or reception of data
to be accessed until any ongoing communication involving the particular
processes has been finalized.

> ``` python
> #!/usr/bin/env python
> from mpi4py import MPI
>
> # Communicator
> comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
>
> # Get the rank of the current process in the communicator group
> rank = comm.Get_rank()
>
> # Variable to receive the data
> data = None
>
> # Process with rank 0 sends data to process with rank 1
> if rank == 0:
>     send = comm.isend(42, dest=1)
>     send.wait()
>
> # Process with rank 1 receives and stores data
> if rank == 1:
>     receive = comm.irecv(source=0)
>     data = receive.wait()
>
> # Each process in the communicator group prints its data
> print(f'After isend/ireceive, the value in process {rank} is {data}')
> ```

Executing `mpiexec -n 4 python isend_ireceive.py` yields:

> ``` bash
> After isend/ireceive, the value in process 2 is None
> After isend/ireceive, the value in process 3 is None
> After isend/ireceive, the value in process 0 is None
> After isend/ireceive, the value in process 1 is 42
> ```

## MPI Collective Communication Examples

### Broadcast

The `bcast()` method and it is buffered version `Bcast()` broadcast a
message from a specified "root" process to all other processes in the
communicator group.

In terms of syntax, `bcast()` takes the object to be broadcast and the
parameter `root`, which establishes the rank number of the process
broadcasting the data. If no root parameter is specified, `bcast` will
default to broadcasting from the process with rank 0.

In this example, we broadcast a two-entry Python dictionary from a root
process to the rest of the processes in the communicator group.

![Broadcasting data from a root process to the rest of the processes in
the communicator
group](https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-mpi/raw/main/doc/images/bcast.png)

The following code snippet shows the creation of the dictionary in
process with rank 0. Notice how the variable `data` remains empty in all
the other processes.

> ``` python
> #!/usr/bin/env python
> from mpi4py import MPI
>
> # Set up the MPI Communicator
> comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
>
> # Get the rank of the current process in the communicator group
> rank = comm.Get_rank()
>
> if rank == 0:  # Process with rank 0 gets the data to be broadcast
>     data = {'size': [1, 3, 8],
>             'name': ['disk1', 'disk2', 'disk3']}
> else:  # Other processes' data is empty
>     data = None
>
> # Print data in each process
> print(f'before broadcast, data on rank {rank} is: {data}')
>
> # Data from process with rank 0 is broadcast to other processes in our
> # communicator group
> data = comm.bcast(data, root=0)
>
> # Print data in each process after broadcast
> print(f'after broadcast, data on rank {rank} is: {data}')
> ```

After running `mpiexec -n 4 python broadcast.py` we get the following:

As we can see, all other processes received the data broadcast from the
root process.

In our next example, we broadcast a NumPy array from process 0 to the
rest of the processes in the communicator group using the uppercase
`comm.Bcast()` method.

> ``` python
> #!/usr/bin/env python
> import numpy as np
> from mpi4py import MPI
>
> # Communicator
> comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
>
> # Get the rank of the current process in the communicator group
> rank = comm.Get_rank()
>
> # Rank 0 gets a NumPy array containing values from 0 to 9
> if rank == 0:
>     data = np.arange(0, 10, 1, dtype='i')
>
> # Rest of the processes get an empty buffer
> else:
>     data = np.zeros(10, dtype='i')
>
> # Print data in each process before broadcast
> print(f'before broadcasting, data for rank {rank} is: {data}')
>
> # Broadcast occurs
> comm.Bcast(data, root=0)
>
> # Print data in each process after broadcast
> print(f'after broadcasting, data for rank {rank} is: {data}')
> ```

Executing `mpiexec -n 4 python npbcast.py` yields:

>     before broadcasting, data for rank 1 is:  [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
>     before broadcasting, data for rank 2 is:  [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
>     before broadcasting, data for rank 3 is:  [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
>     before broadcasting, data for rank 0 is:  [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
>     after broadcasting, data for rank 0 is:  [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
>     after broadcasting, data for rank 2 is:  [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
>     after broadcasting, data for rank 3 is:  [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
>     after broadcasting, data for rank 1 is:  [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]

As we can see, the values in the array at the process with rank 0 have
been broadcast to the rest of the processes in the communicator group.

#### Scatter

In this example, with `scatter` the members of a list among the
processes in the communicator group.

Executing `mpiexec -n 4 python scatter.py` yields:

>     before scattering, data on rank 2 is  None

>     data for rank 1 is  4
>     data for rank 3 is  16
>     data for rank 0 is  1

The members of the list from process 0 have been successfully scattered
among the rest of the processes in the communicator group.

In the following example, we scatter a NumPy array among the processes
in the communicator group by using the uppercase version of the method
`comm.Scatter()`.

Executing `mpiexec -n 4 python npscatter.py` yields:

>     recvbuf in  1:  [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

>     Buffer in process 1 contains:  [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]

As we can see, the values in the 2-D array at process with rank 0, have
been scattered among all our processes in the communicator group, based
on their rank value.

#### Gather

-   [ ] TODO: Fidel, explenation is missing

In this example, data from each process in the communicator group is
gathered in the process with rank 0.

![Example to gather data to different processors from the one with rank
0](https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-mpi/raw/main/doc/images/gather.png)

> ``` python
> #!/usr/bin/env python
> from mpi4py import MPI
>

>
> # Number of processes in the communicator group
> size = comm.Get_size()
>
> # Get the rank of the current process in the communicator group
> rank = comm.Get_rank()
>
> # Each process gets different data, depending on its rank number
> data = (rank + 1) ** 2
>
> # Print data in each process
> print(f'before gathering, data on rank {rank} is: {data}')
>
> # Gathering occurs
> data = comm.gather(data, root=0)
>
> # Process 0 prints out the gathered data, rest of the processes
> # print their data as well

>     print(f'after gathering, process 0\'s data is: {data}')
> else:

> ```

Executing `mpiexec -n 4 python gather.py` yields:

>     before gathering, data on rank 2 is  9
>     before gathering, data on rank 3 is  16
>     before gathering, data on rank 0 is  1
>     before gathering, data on rank 1 is  4
>     after gathering, data in rank 2 is  None
>     after gathering, data in rank 1 is  None
>     after gathering, data in rank 3 is  None
>     after gathering, process 0's data is  [1, 4, 9, 16]

The data from processes with rank `1` to `size - 1` have been
successfully gathered in process 0.

The example showcases the use of the uppercase method `comm.Gather()`.
NumPy arrays from the processes in the communicator group are gathered
into a 2-D array in process with rank 0.

#### Gathering buffer-like objects in all processes

In this example, each process in the communicator group computes and
stores values in a NumPy array (row). For each process, these values
correspond to the multiples of the process' rank and the integers in the
range of the communicator group's size. After values have been computed
in each process, the different arrays are gathered into a 2D array
(table) and distributed to ALL the members of the communicator group (as
opposed to a single member, which is the case when `comm.Gather()` is
used instead).

![Example to gather the data from each process into ALL of the processes
in the
group](https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-mpi/raw/main/doc/images/allgather.png)

> ``` python
> #!/usr/bin/env python
> import numpy as np
> from mpi4py import MPI
>
> # Communicator group
> comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
>
> # Number of processes in the communicator group 
> size = comm.Get_size()
>
> # Get the rank of the current process in the communicator group
> rank = comm.Get_rank()
>
> # Initialize array and table
> row = np.zeros(size)
> table = np.zeros((size, size))
>
> # Each process computes the local values and fills its array
> for i in range(size):
>     j = i * rank
>     row[i] = j
>
> # Print array in each process
> print(f'Process {rank} table before Allgather: {table}\n')
>
> # Gathering occurs
> comm.Allgather([row, MPI.INT], [table, MPI.INT])
>
> # Print table in each process after gathering
> print(f'Process {rank} table after Allgather: {table}\n')
> ```

Executing

>     $ mpiexec -n 4 python allgather_buffer.py

results in the output

>     Process 1 table before Allgather:  [[0. 0.]
>      [0. 0.]] 
>
>     Process 0 table before Allgather:  [[0. 0.]
>      [0. 0.]] 
>
>     Process 1 table after Allgather:  [[0. 0.]
>      [0. 1.]] 
>
>     Process 0 table after Allgather:  [[0. 0.]
>      [0. 1.]] 

As we see, after `comm.Allgather()` is called, every process gets a copy
of the full multiplication table.

#### Dynamic Process Management with `spawn`

Using \> `python > MPI.Comm_Self.Spawn >`

will create a child process that can communicate with the parent. In the
spawn code example, the manager broadcasts an array to the worker.

In this example, we have two python programs, the first one being the
manager and the second being the worker.

![Example to spawn a program and start it on the different processors
from the one with rank
0](https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-mpi/raw/main/doc/images/spawn.png)

> ``` python
> #!/usr/bin/env python
> from mpi4py import MPI
> import numpy
> import sys
> import time
> print("Hello")
> comm = MPI.COMM_SELF.Spawn(sys.executable,
>                            args=['worker.py'],
>                            maxprocs=5)
> rank = comm.Get_rank()
> print(f"b and rank: {rank}")
>
> N = numpy.array(100, 'i')
> comm.Bcast([N, MPI.INT], root=MPI.ROOT)
> #print(f"ROOT: {MPI.ROOT}")
> print('c')
> PI = numpy.array(0.0, 'd')
>
> print('d')
> comm.Reduce(None, [PI, MPI.DOUBLE],
>             op=MPI.SUM, root=MPI.ROOT)
> print(PI)
>
> comm.Disconnect()
> ```

> ``` python
> #!/usr/bin/env python
> from mpi4py import MPI
> import numpy
> import time
> import sys
> comm = MPI.Comm.Get_parent()
> size = comm.Get_size()
> rank = comm.Get_rank()
>
> N = numpy.array(0, dtype='i')
> comm.Bcast([N, MPI.INT], root=0)
> print(f"N: {N} rank: {rank}")
>
> h = 1.0 / N
> s = 0.0
> for i in range(rank, N, size):
>     x = h * (i + 0.5)
>     s += 4.0 / (1.0 + x**2)
> PI = numpy.array(s * h, dtype='d')
> comm.Reduce([PI, MPI.DOUBLE], None,
>             op=MPI.SUM, root=0)
>
> #time.sleep(60)
> comm.Disconnect()
> #MPI.Finalize()
> #sys.exit()
> #MPI.Unpublish_name()
> #MPI.Close_port()
> ```

To execute the example please go to the examples directory and run the
manager program

>     $ cd examples/spawn
>     $ mpiexec -n 4 python manager.py

This will result in:

>     N: 100 rank: 4
>     N: 100 rank: 1
>     N: 100 rank: 3
>     N: 100 rank: 2
>     Hello
>     b and rank: 0
>     c
>     d
>     3.1416009869231245
>     N: 100 rank: 0
>     N: 100 rank: 1
>     N: 100 rank: 4
>     N: 100 rank: 3
>     N: 100 rank: 2
>     Hello
>     b and rank: 0
>     c
>     d
>     3.1416009869231245
>     N: 100 rank: 0

This output depends on which child process is received first. The output
can vary.

## Futures

Futures is an mpi4py module that runs processes in parallel for
intercommunication between such processes. The following Python program
creates a visualization of a Julia set by utilizing this Futures
modules, specifically via MPIPoolExecutor.

> y0, y1, h = -1.5, +1.5, 480*multiplier
> dx = (x1 - x0) / w
> dy = (y1 - y0) / h
>
> c = complex(0, 0.65)
>
> def julia(x, y):
>     z = complex(x, y)
>     n = 255
>     while abs(z) < 3 and n > 1:

>         n -= 1
>     return n
>
> def julia_line(k):
>     line = bytearray(w)
>     y = y1 - k * dy
>     for j in range(w):
>         x = x0 + j * dx
>         line[j] = julia(x, y)
>     return line
>
> if __name__ == '__main__':
>
>     with MPIPoolExecutor() as executor:
>         image = executor.map(julia_line, range(h))
>         image = np.array([list(l) for l in image])
>         plt.imsave("julia.png", image)
>
> StopWatch.stop("Overall time")
> StopWatch.benchmark()
> ```

The program must be run through the terminal with the command:

`mpiexec -n 1 python julia-futures.py`

The number after `-n` can be changed to however many cores are in the
computer's processor. For example, a dual-core processor can use `-n 2`
so that more worker processes work to execute the same program.

The program should output a png image of a Julia set upon successful
execution.

How to use Numpy with MPI 1. Download Numpy with `pip install numpy` in
a terminal 2. `import numpy as np` to use numpy in the program 3.
Advantages of numpy over lists - Numpy stores memory contiguously - Uses
a smaller number of bytes - Can multiply arrays by index - It's faster -
Can store different data types including images - Contains random number
generators

Numpy syntax 1. To define an array type: `np.nameofarray([1,2,3])` 2. To

of the array (the number of rows and columns): `nameofarray.shape` 4. To
get the type of the array: `nameofarray.dtype` 5. To get the number of
bytes: `nameofarray.itemsize` 6. To get the number of elements in the
array: `nameofarray.size` 7. To get the total size:

## Monte Carlo Calculation of Pi

We start with the mathematical formulation of the Monte Carlo
calculation of pi. For each quadrant of the unit square, the area is pi.
Therefore, the ratio of the area outside of the circle is pi over four.
With this in mind, we can use the Monte Carlo Method for the calculation
of pi.

The following is a visualization of the program's methodology to
calculate pi:
![montecarlographic](https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-mpi/raw/main/doc/chapters/images/monte-carlo-visualization.png)

The following montecarlo.py program generates a very rough estimation of
pi using the methodology and equation shown above.

> ``` python
> import random as r
> import math as m
> import time
>
> start = time.time()
> # Number of darts that land inside.
> inside = 0
> # Total number of darts to throw.
> total = 100000
>
> # Iterate for the number of darts.
> for i in range(0, total):
>   # Generate random x, y in [0, 1].
>     x2 = r.random()**2
>     y2 = r.random()**2
>     # Increment if inside unit circle.
>     if m.sqrt(x2 + y2) < 1.0:
>         inside += 1
>
> # inside / total = pi / 4
> pi = (float(inside) / total) * 4
> end = time.time()
>
> # It works!
> print(pi)
>
> #Total time it takes to execute, this changes based off total
> print(end - start)
> ```

However, if a more exact approximation of pi is needed, then the
following program can be run instead, using multiple cores of the
processor using mpiexec:

To run this program using git bash, change directory to the folder
containing this program and issue the command:
`$ mpiexec -n 2 python parallel_pi.py` The number after `-n` can be
changed to however many cores one has on their processor.

### Program

-   [ ] TODO: Open, Example program to run Montecarlo on multiple hosts

-   [ ] TODO: Open, Benchmarking of the code

Use for benchmarking \* cloudmesh.common (not thread-safe, but still can
be used, research how to use it in multiple threads) \* other strategies
to benchmark, you research (only if really needed \* Use numba to speed
up the code \* describe how to install \* showcase basic usage on our
monte carlo function \* display results with matplotlib

### Counting Numbers

The following program generates arrays of random numbers each 20 (n) in
length with the highest number possible being 10 (max_number). It then
uses a function called count() to count the number of 8's in each data
set. The number of 8's in each list is stored count_data. Count_data is
then summed and printed out as the total number of 8's.

Executing `mpiexec -n 4 python count.py` gives us:

> 1 1 \[7, 5, 2, 1, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5, 2, 6, 5, 2, 1, 8, 7, 10, 9, 5, 6\]

## GPU Programming with MPI

Only possibly for someone with GPU (contact me if you do) Once we are
finished with MPI we will use and look at python dask and other
frameworks as well as rest services to interface with the MPI programs.
This way we will be able to expose the cluster to anyone and they do not
even know they use a cluster while exposing this as a single function
... (edited)

The Github repo is used by all of you to have write access and
contribute to the research effort easily and in parallel. You will get
out of this as much as you put in. Thus it is important to set several
dedicated hours aside (ideally each week) and contribute your work to
others.

It is difficult to assess how long the previous task takes as we just
get started and we need to learn first how we work together as a team.
If I were to do this alone it may take a week, but as you are less
experienced it would likely take longer. However, to decrease the time
needed we can split up work and each of you will work on a dedicated
topic (but you can still work in smaller teams if you desire). We will
start assigning tasks in GitHub once this is all set up.

## Python Ecosystem

It is possible to pass parameters from Git Bash into a Python
environment using os.environ and a shell file.

> ``` python
> from cloudmesh.common.StopWatch import StopWatch
> from time import sleep
> import os
>
> n=int(os.environ["N"])
> StopWatch.start(f"processors {n}")
> sleep(0.1*n)
> print(n)
> StopWatch.stop(f"processors {n}")
> StopWatch.benchmark()
> ```

Ensure that this code is saved in a particular directory. Then create a
shell file named run.sh with the following contents:

``` python
$ N=1; python environment-parameter.py
$ N=2; python environment-parameter.py
```

Save the following py file in the same directory as well: \>
`python > !include ../examples/parameters/click-parameter.py >`

You must cd (change directory) into the directory with all of these
files in Git Bash. Input the following commands into Git Bash:

    # This command creates an environment variable called N
    $ export N=10
    # This command prints the environment variable called N
    $ echo $N
    # This command launches a Python environment
    $ python -i
    >>> import os
    >>> os.environ["N"]
    >>> exit()
    $ python environment-parameter.py
    $ sh run.sh
    $ sh run.sh | fgrep "csv,processors"
    $ python click-parameter.py
    # You can manually set the variable in git bash in the same line as you open the .py file
    $ python click-parameter.py --n=3

# Make on Windows

Makefiles provide a good feature to organize workflows while assembling
programs or documents to create an integrated document. Within
`makefiles` you can define targets that you can call and are then
executed. Preconditions can be used to execute rules conditionally. This
mechanism can easily be used to define complex workflows that require a
multitude of interdependent actions to be performed. Makefiles are
executed by the program `make` that is available on all platforms.

On Linux, it is likely to be pre-installed, while on macOS you can
install it with Xcode. On Windows, you have to install it explicitly. We
recommend that you install `gitbash` first. After you install `gitbash`,
you can install `make` from an administrative `gitbash` terminal window.
To start one, go to the search field next to the Windows icon on the
bottom left and type in gitbash without a `RETURN`. You will then see a
selection window that includes
`Run as administrator. Click on it. As you run it as administrator, it will allow you to install`make\`.
The following instructions will provide you with a guide to install make
under windows.

## Installation {#installation}

Please visit

-   <https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/>

and download the file

-   ['make-4.3-without-guile-w32-bin.zip'](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/make-4.3-without-guile-w32-bin.zip/download)

After the download, you have to extract and unzip the file as follows in
a gitbash that you started as administrative user:

![administrativegitbash](https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-mpi/raw/main/doc/chapters/images/gitbashadmin.png)

figure: screenshot of opening gitbash in admin shell

> ``` bash
> $ cp make-4.3-without-guile-w32-bin.zip /usr
> $ cd /usr
> $ unzip make-4.3-without-guile-w32-bin.zip
> ```

Now start a new terminal (a regular non-administrative one) and type the
command

> ``` bash
> $ which make
> ```

It will provide you the location if the installation was successful

> ``` bash
> /usr/bin/make
> ```

to make sure it is properly installed and in the correct directory.

## Installing WSL on Windows 10

WSL is a layer that allows the running of Linux executables on a Windows
machine.

To install WSL2 your computer must have Hyper-V support enabled. This
does not work on Windows Home, and you need to upgrade to Windows Pro,
Edu, or some other Windows 10 version that supports it. Windows Edu is
typically free for educational institutions. The Hyper-V must be enabled
from your Bios, and you need to change your settings if it is not
enabled.

More information about WSL is provided at

-   <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10>

To install WSL2, you can follow these steps while using Powershell as an
administrative user and run

>     ps$ dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
>     ps$ dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
>     ps$ wsl --set-default-version 2

Next, Download the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS image from the Microsoft store

-   <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6?activetab=pivot:overviewtab>

Run Ubuntu and create a username and passphrase.

Make sure not just to give an empty passphrase but chose a secure one.

Next run in Powershell

>     ps$ wsl.exe --set-version Ubuntu20.04 2

Now you can use the Ubuntu distro freely. The WSL2 application will be
in your shortcut menu in `Start`.
