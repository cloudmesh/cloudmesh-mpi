what to plot:
    repeat 10 experiments for each process number and for each n

plots by size:
    on x-axis: p
    on y-axis: time
    constant: n

plots by process:
    on x-axis: n
    on y-axis: time
    constant: p

plot speedup:
    on x-axis: p
    on y-axis: s = time(1) / time(p)

plot efficiency:
    x-axis: p
    y-axis: efficiency = S / p
